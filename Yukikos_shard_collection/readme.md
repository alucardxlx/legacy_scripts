# This is a collection of "complete worlds" that I have  #
# collected from various places. I used quotes around    #
# complete worlds because some of the server/shard       #
# script sets are not complete worlds but were the only  #
# scripts contained in the archive that was available.   #
#                                                        #
# These are shards that were either released publicly on #
# sites such as polserver.com, yahoo script forum (now   #
# defunct), publicly visable repos or were given to me   #
# with the expressed permission that I could share them  #
# with others.                                           #
#                                                        #
# Some servers/shards I hold that I cannot release       #
# either because I was asked not to share or because     #
# they were never released publicly. I only include      #
# this paragraph to assure those who have trusted me     #
# to keep their server scripts in confidence that I      #
# value their trust and am abiding by my promise.        #
#                                                        #
# These scripts sets are spread across a wide spectrum   #
# of POL versions from POL 092 to POL 098. At least I    #
# think I have some as late as POL 098.                  #
# Most of the scripts will require major updating to     #
# be compatible with the current version of POL, 099.1   #
# at the time I created this readme.                     #
#                                                        #
