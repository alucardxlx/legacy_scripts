Hire Npc Script By:

bug reports, or modifications mailto:
thescorned@iname.com to reduce files on onelist.

Installation:

1) Place Merchant_hire.src, Merchant_hire.ecl, hired.src, hired.ecl in pol/scripts/ai/

2) Backup existing merchant.ecl script
	- Optional merchant.src

3) Rename Merchant_hire.ecl to merchant.ecl 
	- Optional merchant_hire.src -> merchant.src

When the player says hire, the npc says I will work for thee for <amount> gold, when amount
is given the npc acts like a tamed animal (follows the same commands)

Todo: 

Make player editing of the npc name unavailable
Make npcs state a random amount of gold
Fix hire script so when npc name is said, only the npc with the name will respond (currently
	all npcs will respond)
Make npcs use titles instead of names such as: Lincoln the stablemaster.
Add code to other scripts instead of just the merchant
make only certain npcs listen to hire, so players don't hire all your vendors.

Anyone willing to help fix these problems are welcome to it : )
Any bug reports email me.
