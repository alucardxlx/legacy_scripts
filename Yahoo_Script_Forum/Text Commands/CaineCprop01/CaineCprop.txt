Caine Cprop text command v0.1
-----------------------------

I wanted a .<txtcmd> to change the cprops on some of my items and players (hehehe, this is to save you/me time in debugging and player fixing *smile*)

there are 2 cmds available now :

1) .setcprop [i/s] [propname] [amount]
	i/s	: is a required argument : donates if amount is of str type or int
	propname: is a required argument : donates what cprop to be added
	amount	: is a required argument : donates the value of the cprop

	ie. 
	--------------------
	.setcprop i #flee 1

this will set the #flee cprop on an item/mobile to an int value of 1.



2) .delcprop [propname] ([propname2]...)
	propname: is a required argument : donates what cprop to be erased
       propname2: is an optional argument : dontes what other cprop to be erased (more than one allowed)

	ie. 
	---------------------
	.delcprop frozen is_poisoned #flee lasthit
	
this will erase the frozen, is_posioned #flee and lasthit cprops from an item or moblile.


have fun ;)
