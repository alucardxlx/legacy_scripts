Text commands
by Angreal

ok...these are mostly 'quick build' commands and were modified from preexisting commands, at least
in so far as the some of the functions used...

destroyradius - this is basically the itemwipe command but I always forgot about that one....
		destroyradius was easier for me to remember :)
makefloor     - maybe I shouldn't be including this one since it was already written by someone else (no idea who),
		but it was 'bugged' in that it only allowed for a single tile to be used...now you specify the
		tile/item you want and how many you want (be sure to be standing in the direction yuou want em
		to go :)
moverect      - handy dandy little command that allows you to move a rectangle of objects in any direction as far
		as you want, i.e. .moverect px 12 will move the rectangle you specify with clicks in the positive x
		direction 12 squares.....:) great for buildings....
raiserect     - this is basically a direction specific command similar to moverect....it *only* moves the rectangle
		you specify in the positive z direction.....
rangerect     - this will lay out a random set of objects in the area you specify, this is anothr great command for
		doing buildings...makes floors even easier than makefloor though the 'area' is harder to define
		since you are doing it with mouse clicks.....
unlockradius  - the name says it all :)
