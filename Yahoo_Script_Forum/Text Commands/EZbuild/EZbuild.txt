What is EZbuild?

EZbuild a group of commands that create a small graveyard, random camp, or Spider lair all with monsters.

___

CAMP:

Type .camp # to create a random 10 item camp.  

Usage is: .Camp [#]
Current camps are:
1=Orc
2=Lizard
3=Troll
4=Etten/Ogre
5=Ratmen
6=Empty camp

Sometimes items are placed on top of eachother or in bad positions. So some .destroy might be needed. 

___

GRAVE:

Type .grave to create a random 10 item graveyard with random undead creatures. Same as above with using .destroy. Most of the time it works just fine and saves a lot of time.

___

Web:

Type .web to create a random 10 item Spider Lair with random spiders. Same as above with using .destroy. Most of the time it works just fine and saves a lot of time. This works great in caves and dungeons.

___

Installing:

Drop the camp.src and grave.src into your Pol\scripts\textcmd\seer directory. Compile and enjoy.
