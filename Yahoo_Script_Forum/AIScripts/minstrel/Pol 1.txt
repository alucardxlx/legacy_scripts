just a little diddy here....
minstrel walks around playing tunes for the folk....

there are 4 sample songs included (songs.cfg)...just follow the format shown by those
and everything will be all cool :)

in the singsongs() you will need to change the following if you add more songs.....
local numsongs := <how many songs you have in the cfg file.....>
currently this is set at 4 since I have 4 songs in there :) I know there is a better way
to do this but I was lazy.....

drop the songs.cfg into the config folder....

drop the minstrel.src into the ai folder and compile.....

playmidi is a textcmd so that you can test through the midi files if you wanna :)

oh yeah....add the minstrel dude to the npcdesc file.....

keep in mind none of this is perfect :0

email me with any comments, suggestions, flames or whatever :)

Additions by Madman Across the Water:
Removed playmidi, as it was redundant.
Max number of songs is now a config element, so you don't have to recompile every
time you add a song.
Songs default to having a soundeffect accompany them. If you wish them to play a 
midi, add the line "midi ##" where the number is _in hex_ for which midi you want 
to have go with the song. I did not include any default midi selections because
I've changed half the midis on my server and some of you probably did also.
Corrected two typos in this file. :>
And added a second NPC type, performer, which is essentially the minstrel except
doesn't move.
And finally, added the ability for the minstrels and performers to be female by 
adding the random gender generator.
Actually, I just wanted to say "random gender generator."
I think that's all...

Oh, and I added one song. ;>
