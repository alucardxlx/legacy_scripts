reactivearmor.src - place this in your pkg/std/spells directory

reactivearmor_hitscript.src - place this in your /pkg/std/combat directory

mainhitscript.src - this also goes in /pkg/std/combat

The idea is that the reactive armor should reflect an a percentage of a melee attack back at the attacker based on the casters magery. This was tested with several values of magery and several melee attackers (archers, swords, mace...) and seemed to work fine. The only problem I see that *may* need to be further looked at is the removal of the hitscript when the duration of the spell is up....this I have not yet checked :(
