What these files will do

Add AR mods for coloured items. 
Add magical properties for some coloured items. 
Change exceptional to 1.4 and allow only certain colours to be exceptional. 
Add colour of armor into items name. 
Make it harder to make exceptional (2% chance only)

Things to note
Azurite Armor will have a magical property that has a 65% chance of magic reflecting (change this if you feel like it)
For this to work the wearer must have 7 azurite items equiped (this can include weapons, or armor underneath other armor)

Malachite Armor will have a magical property that has a 75% chance of allowing spell casting and will also allow meditation (even in plate)
For this to work the wearer must have 6 malachite items equiped (this can include weapons, or armor underneath other armor - altho casting is impossible with all normal weapons equiped)

To make malachite armor worthwhile I made it impossible to cast in plate. 

Only newly created armor will have any of these changes.

If you are unhappy with any of this I dont suggest you install this pkg unless you know how to script. I have commented my code fairly well (I think) and it shouldnt be to hard to change it. 

Instalation
Step 1. Unzip straight into your pol folder (meditation and blacksmithy should end up in pkg/std, while include should end up in scripts/include)
Step 2. Recompile all of your scripts (I have no idea which of your scripts use the spellrestrictions.inc)
