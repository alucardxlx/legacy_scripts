Armslore script by Shai`tan and Rincewind.
Well this is according to stratics, I added new props to std\combat\itemdesc.cfg
MinDam and Maxdam so you too can use them when reading the cfg. 

Step 1. Unzip these files to the armslore pkg in /pkg/std
Step 2. Move itemdesc.cfg into pkg/std/combat (Overwrite it)
	If you have added any new types of weapons or armour you will need to readd them to the new itemdesc.cfg
Step 3. Compile the script
