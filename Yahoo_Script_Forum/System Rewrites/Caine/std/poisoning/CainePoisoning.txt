CainePoisoning
--------------

This was changed to work with my Alchemy pkg (CaineAlch).

Poison potions are now read in correctly... and damage and duration is done according to poison strength.

And now you can't poison everything. 

Great.

So now it works, hopefully. ;))

AAARG! found a huge bug in their script... and just too late, darn! It would poison once correctly, and for every other time you poisoned the posioned weapon... it would add a hitscript, makeing the effects of a weapon really unbelivable.

also, added partial successes, (for all the posioners among us).
if you fail the initial check, it will re-check on potions that require a skill above 50, 'cause i use the formula ( skill-10 >= 40 ). If you do score a partial success, the potions effective str is reduced by 2.
