Advanced Cooking - version 1.0

Instructions
============

Unzip this package at pol/pkg/opt/advcooking
You also need to disable normal cooking at pol/pkg/std/cooking
Some of my items can overwrit yours. In that case, you'll need to change
mine. Do it at the itemdesc.cfg and cooking2.cfg files.

How does it work?
=================

Players can cook foods at the same way as in Adv. Alchemy, using a
Cooking Book.


Special Thanks
==============

To Charles Haustron (SpEkA), for the Adv. Alchemy script that he allowed 
me to use as a basis for this Advanced Cooking package;
Julio Cesar, Abaddon e Seifer (my friend), for the incentive;
To Toozler, who searched for the sounds and incentived me a lot;
To Hugo P.L., who helped me at the package itself, making the program
that searches for ovens and heat sources.


ToDo
====

Adding new recipes would be great, like different kinds of pizza...
Another cool thing would be making farming addictions, so that the player
could do flour from wheat (using it at a Flourmill). 
You can also add milk doses at cows and honey doses at beehives, using
that as a 5 minutes resource, so that the players can obtain their
own raw materials...

In case of any doubt, e-mail me immediately.
