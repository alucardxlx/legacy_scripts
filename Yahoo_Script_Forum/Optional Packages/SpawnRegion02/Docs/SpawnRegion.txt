SPAWN REGION v0.2
=================
Written by: Oroborous, mkow@sympatico.ca

This package is a replacement for the outdated RegionalSpawner package.  It has a few
nifty features and is self-cleaning, meaning that it will correct any dicrepancies that
may occur during its operation or when you edit the config files.

HISTORY
=======
0.2		Removed some bugs, increase spawning efficiancy with multiple processes.
0.1		Initial Release.

INSTALLATION
============
Just drop into pkg/std and configure the SpawnRegions.cfg and SpawnGroups.cfg.  Make
sure that all of your data in both configs is CASE SENSITIVE and matches each file, or
you will get error messages on the console, and possibly some wierdness I have been
unable to track down.

To compile, make sure you put all of the includes from the 'ScriptIncludes' dir to your
scripts/include directory.

**WARNING**
Some of those files have been modified by me considerably so you better look and
compare and merge instead of just copying or you will mess up your other scripts. You
have been warned!

In every AI script: AiSerial MUST be set on every NPC that uses this spawner.

SetObjProperty(me, "AiSerial", me.serial);

Changes to death.src: Just drop that code into your death.src and recompile.

COMMANDS
========
.restartspawnregionmanager [v]
This command restarts the spawn region manager and forces it to do validation of all its
data. It will also correct any probelems on restart, so if something wierd happens, just
restart it, and the problem should go away.  The manager spawns 1 region per cycle, and
also handles all messages sent from NPC deaths.

.regionmanager [start | stop]
This command opens the Spawn Region Manager gump.  It is a very powerful tool that allows
you to micro manage each ragion down to the individual spawns.  You can spawn, respawn, despawn,
enable or disable any group within a region.  It also allows you to kill individual spawns
within a region.  Another nifty feature is the "Go To" options.  You can goto an individual
spawn in a region, or to the centre (or random spot if centre is inaccessible) of the region.
If Start or Stop are passed, it will either start or stop spawning critters. NOTE: Any spawner processes
will not be killed if stop is used, they will complete as normal, but no new ones will start.



SPAWN REGION MANAGER
====================

REGION SELECTION SCREEN
You can choose what region to manage or go to.  It shows a list of all your regions.

REGION MANAGEMENT SCREEN
Lists all the groups within a region.  The 'S' check box marks whether a group is
enabled or disabled.  Disabled groups do not spawn until enabled.  You can check which
groups should spawn/despawn or respawn. Respawn overrides the other two, as it performs
a despawn and then a spawn on the group anyhow.  Details will take you to the Group Spawn
Screen.  Right click anywhere on the gump to refresh it.  Sometimes it takes a bit for
the info to be refreshed, so just refresh a few times and wait.

GROUP SPAWN SCREEN
This screen lets you either kill or goto a specific spawn.  The spawns are listed
according to what template they belong to.  Sometimes you will see <unreferenced object>
or some such here, that's because the spawns have been killed, but they have not been
wiped from the spawns list just yet.  Just wait and it should go away.  Restarting the
Spawn Region Manager should fix any of those errors as well, should they persist.

TIPS
====
Do not make spawn groups more than 60.  Anything more will force the death script to run for
too long as it deregisters its serial from the proper region and group.  I suggest creating
multiple groups with a max of 40-50 spawns. This is a better method also because you can disable
half the spawns in a region to make it more sparse, without too much work.
