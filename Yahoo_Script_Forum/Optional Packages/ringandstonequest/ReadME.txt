Ring and Stone quest system.

This is a quest enhancement system but can really be used for a number of things. Basically what this does is allows you to create
"portal stones" and "rings of power" that are used to use the stones. The player finds a ring and then finds the location of a stone.
That stone has co-ordinates programmed into it that a gm specifies. The player double clicks the ring near the stone and an effect
plays and marks some cprops on the player. Then at any time the player can double click on the stone (or any stone in any location) and it instantly teleports them to the location programmed into the stone. It also records where they came from as a cprop on the player. Then at the destination when they are done there they can double click on another stone there and it will bring them back to the first one. This can be used for quests or as a way to gain entry to special areas or even a whole transportation system shard wide. You can test it by using a ring yourself as a gm. However if you double click on the stone as a gm without first powering up with the ring, your cursor will turn into a target. You can then target a rune to program the stone. 

Installation:

Just drop this under /pol/pkg and restart the shard. It doesn't have any conflicts that I am aware of and is full tested and compiled for POL 0.94 final. It uses item #'s 0x580e and 0x580f, if these are in use just change them to other numbers in itemdesc.cfg in the package.
