Travel Stone v1.0
-----------------

Ok this was in no way to be completed by me.
It was created to help out some of those who I have seen post in the
forums about the map menu that comes up when you first join.

I made this stone, which would be pretty easy to modify the code,
in order for it to popup when the user first logs in.

Look at the code, see how it places the button and the text for each
location, and add the other ones that you want/need.

I would like to note, that the idea of the general layout of the
cities came from Santiago Shard ... *gasp* I loved playing there
back in the day, before I knew about POL. And the travel stone was
a definate help back then when I knew nothing about runes :) haha

This code was written AEONS ago by me, and I found it finally amongst
some old shard backups, from waaaaaaaaay back. Maybe some day I'll
finish it if I feel like it, but I may just go optimize and modify
it and re-release it. It should run in 095 too...

So ya, here you go, enjoy.
