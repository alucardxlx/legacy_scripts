SpawnPoint v0.3
===============
Written by: GM Mercy, mkow@sympatico.ca

Spawn point allows you to create specific spawns.  It is very much like SpawnNet,
except that it is more efficient by using events instead of polling.

HISTORY
=======
0.3	- Changed default frequency from 1 min to 5 min, seems bug free... :)
0.2 - Added VerifyPointSpawns() that checks for invalid serials and removes them so that
	things can keep spawning in case of problems.  This happens every 5 minutes by default.
	- Fixed a problem with the HrStart and HrEnd comparisons.
	- Npcs are despawned if they exist outside the HrStart and HrEnd.
	- Added new event on point config change, SpawnPointManager is more efficient now.
0.1 - Initial release.

INSTALLATION
============
Drop into pkg/std.

Go through the scripts in the ScriptIncludes directory and cut and paste or copy the whole script to your own
include dir.

**WARNING**
Remember that just copying may break some of your existing scripts, since some of these files
have been customized by me.  You have been warned!!

In death.src add:
------<cut>----------
include "../pkg/std/SpawnPoint/SpawnPoint";
SpawnPointDeath(corpse);
------<cut>----------

In your AI scripts you must set a CProp called AiSerial on the mobile.  This is requied
so that the corpse contains the serial of the critter that died (CProps are copied to the
corpse on death).  If you don't do this, the package will still work, but it will not be
as efficient because it will have to validate all serials every 5 minutes, unless you change
the interval const in SpawnPoint.inc.  I suggest adding the AiSerial CProp.

EXPIRY
======
You can set the amount of time in minutes until the SpawnPoint destroys itself.  This
is very useful for temporary spawn points.  It frees you from having to destroy spawn
points manually when you know you will not need them after a period of time.  You can also
set the amount of spawns before point expires.  Disabled runes do not destroy themselves
after time is up, they will have to be re-enabled.

HRSTART & HREND
===============
The hours between which the NPC will spawn.  Remember that time is listed in 24 hr format,
1 being 1am and 24 being 12am.  If you specify both of the parameters as 0, then no time checking
will be done (this is the default).  NPCs are killed automatically if they exist during a time
period when the point does not spawn.  Allows you to have certain NPCs only exist at certain times.

EVENTS
======
Add these events to your eventid.inc.  Assign non-conflicting event IDs to them.
//	EVID_SPAWNPOINT_CREATED
// 	EVID_SPAWNPOINT_DESTROYED
//	EVID_SPAWN_DEATH			Used from the death.src script.
