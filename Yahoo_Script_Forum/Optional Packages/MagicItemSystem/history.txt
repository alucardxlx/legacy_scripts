v1.14
-[Files Required]
  All source (.src) and include (.inc) files.
  Your configuration files should be fine, just fine.

-Added Naksu's 'heaven' weapon enchantment

-changed the functionality of the hitscripts
 +They now return the rawdamage to the core, simply using the "return" function:
    SetObjProperty(who,"returnDmg",rawdamage); 
  becomes...
    return rawdamage;

-Converted the system over to 094 core,
 +Last I heard there were some worries about equip/unequip scripts on startup and shutdown...
  +I've tested equiping/unequiping, but not over startup & shutdown.
   +Just be wary of those equip mods thing... check with http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pol-core-test 

 +toSkill's first argument now accepts three inputs:
  1) An Attribute ID.
  2) A Skill ID.
  3) A CProp name, pointing to a Skill ID.
 +How does it know the different between a CProp name and an attribute name?
  +It checks if the attribute is valid, and if not looks for the CProp.
  
-Fixed up (and tested) NPC enchantments.
 +Theres also some docs that will tell you how to make it so you can use "enchantment" lines in npcdesc.cfg

-Fixed up a lot of naming issued with enchantments.
 +NPCs dont get name effects when enchanted. Maybe later.
 +Enchantments added to an item will cause it to be displayed as
    a magic [name]
  eg.
    a magic pitchfork
  +Once an enchantment has been ItemID'd, the names will show up.
   +Enchantments added after it has been IDed, will show up instantly.


v1.13
-Added itemgroups.cfg in configuration\itemgroups
 +Changed functionality for 'biasing'
  +Bias groups can now be defined in itemgroups.cfg (look in CFG, self explanatory)
  +Groups in the CFG must be listed in the "allGroups" element at the top
  +Groups whos items are socketable must be listed in the "socketables" element at the top
  +Biases are defined same as before, you can use the groups you make in itemgroups.cfg now :)
 +Clothes are now a seperate bias to "else" - clothes are non-socketable (seemed logical)
  +You can change this by going to itemgroups.cfg!! :) Add "igroup clothes" to the "socketables" element at the top

-Added a new argument for "toSkill"
 +specifying "wepSkill" as the skill ID, will make the skill bonus goto the skill used by that weapon!
 +heres an example:
  toSkill wepSkill 15

-Added another new argument for "toSkill"
 +Specifying a string in the amount, will cause the script to get the amount from the CProp of that name, ie:
  toSkill wepSkill skillBonus
 +Will make the script add the amount from the CProp "skillBonus", to the skill used by that weapon.


v1.12
-Added a bit of documentation to "docs" folder
 +Moved mench.txt to the "docs" folder
-Changed DEBUG mode to a compile-time constant in senchantedhit.src
 +To enable debug, change the constant "debug" at the top of the file to 1

-Item Specific Bias'ing
 +You can now specify an item object type in the biases of an enchantment, eg:
   Enchantment m_gm_smithys else 0x13e3
   //Clothes, Jewellery, Etc, Smithy hammers :)

-Spell groupings
 +You can now specify a group of spells, like "fire" or "necromancy"
  +The groups are specified in sithmagicitems\configuration\spellgroups.cfg
  +In the "spellResist [id] [percentige]" line, pass the group name as the id:
   spellResist fire 40
   +If you were recreating a zulu shard, a level 1 enchantment could be:
    spellResist all 100
    +lol just jk's :)


v1.11
-Stopped addEnch function from trying to add names to mobiles (for now)
-ItemID modified slightly,
 -Now supports multiple config entries for "idstring"
  +They will be displayed in order of entry...
  +This includes the rune description gumps, which modify their height dynamically to account for it :)
  
-The one I promised in the last "todo" update:
 -Enchantments now support spell resistences and bonuses!!!
  +More config props, once again you can have as many as you want...
   -Format for resistences is:
    spellResist [id] [percentige]
     +percentige is the percentige to absorb. 100 is complete resistence. 50% is half, etc...
     
   -Format for bonuses is:
    spellBonus [id] [percentige]
     +percentige is the percentige of damage to do. 200 is double. 50 is half, etc...
       
  +To enable spell enchantments,
   -See the readme.txt and goto step #7
   -In the spells you want to use, pass the ID (string) onto the end of the Resisted function, ie:
    Resisted(circle,caster,cast_on,dmg,"fstrike")


v1.10
-w00t:
 -Look and feel of item ID changed. Looks heaps cooler.

 -New ItemID button: "Enchant With"
  +This works through the senchantedhit.cfg (like everything,)
  +In the "Data" element, you can add "Enchant With" scripts - format is:
  [ItemID] [Script]
  Theres some examples there,

 -New 'socketAlignments' element in CFG
  +This is for un-dwarven-runestone socketed items using the "Enchant With" button
  +Format is:
  [ItemID] [X-Offset] [Y-Offset]
  +They are pixel offsets for the little picture of the item when you select its socket

 -Couple of new sench.inc functions:
  sortEnchantments( item )
  isSocketedIn( enchantment, item )
  +USE sortEnchantments, after you have added an enchantment that doesnt socket (with the "Enchant With" button)
   ++That way, the socketed enchantments will be @ the bottom, and the non-socketed at the top.


v1.09
-Quickfix to a couple of skill mod issues...
 There is now functions in sench.inc to use in the skillcap'r, so that it wont drop skills over 100 because of item mods:
  getRealSkill( who, skillid )
  getTotalSkillMods( who, skillid )

 So it would be something like
  if( getRealSkill(who,skillid) > max_skill )
    SetSkill( who, skillid, max_skill + getTotalSkillMods(who,skillid) );
  endif

-New enchantments with skill mods will now have a destroy script as well as the equip + unequip scripts.


v1.08
-Where did 1.07 go!
 +'Twas never released, dun worry though, you have 1.08 now.
-Stat and Skill adjustments on equiping and unequiping of the enchanted item!!!
 toStat [statid] [amount]
  -statid is str, dex, or int
 toSkill [skillid] [amount]
  -skillid is the numerical value of the skill (core092)
-More than one of the above in 1 enchantment works fine :) see the m_wizards example.


v1.07
-Never released.


v1.06
-Updated include to version 0.7
-Now supports random prop min/max values, so the AddRanProp in CFGs can now be:
AddRanProp [name] [maxvalue]
AddRanProp [name] [minvalue] [maxvalue]
The script determines it by the numbers of arguments for AddRanProp, so you wont have to change any old enchantments :)
-Removal of enchantments will now remove the ar_mod effect of the enchantment too.
-Removal of enchantments now erases the random CProps to free memory (sah-weet).


v1.05
Merely minutes after the release of 1.04, Myrathi told me to remove the hardcoding of the enchantment strings that show up in the ItemID. So here it is.
If your only upgrading from 1.04, the only new things you need are:
sench.inc
itemid.src
senchantedhit.cfg
If you have added your own enchantments, then move the string from ItemID -> the CFG entry, more info in mench.txt


v1.04
-Multiple ranProps now supported,
 Just add as many "ranProp" entries to the CFG elem as you like :)
-Fixed a bug where correct damage would not be counted till the next hit from that person, or perhaps even never at all, resulting in what seemed like random damage modification.
-Packaged most of the system, its a *lot* cleaner and easier to install now.
-Moved silverhit to enchScripts\, inline with the other hitscrips.
-The 3 items (runestones, tomes, tools) are now in their own itemdesc.
-magicweapons.cfg and magicarmor.cfg are now independent of the combat versions.


v1.03
-Added new props:
  ocArmourMod
  toColour
-Added new prop:
  noNormalMods
-Added new props:
  WasHitScript
  DidHitScript
-Rewrote entire system.
