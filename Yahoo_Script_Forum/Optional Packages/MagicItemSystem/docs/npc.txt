So you want enchanted NPCs.
Maybe you want dragons that recieve more damage from Dragon Slayers crossbows. 
Maybe you want orcs that do more damage to humans wearing certain armour.

If you want your NPCs to recieve a set of enchantments when they are created, heres a nice way to do it.

Goto your scripts\ai directory.
Go into the folder called "setup"

Make an include file something like "checkEnch.inc", and add the following into it:


  include "../pkg/std/combat/sithmagicitems/sench";
  foreach enchantment in GetConfigStringArray(FindConfigElem(ReadConfigFile("::npcdesc"),Self().npctemplate),"enchantment");
      addEnch( Self(), enchantment );
  endforeach


Now, in every AI script whos NPCs you want to be able to set enchantments on... or just all AI scripts... add the following line up the top:


  include "setup/checkEnch";


Now in your npcdesc.cfg, you can add as many "enchantment" lines on an NPC as you want, eg:
