Biasing

Biasing is a way of making enchantments only usable with certain objects, or groups of objects. With biasing we can make enchantments that can only be used on armor, weapons, clothes... anything we need.


Biases are applied in the enchantment header. The enchantment header is that bit right up the top of senchantedhit.cfg with lots of things that look something like this:

	Enchantment dmg2mana all
                       ^      ^
                       |      \
                       |       This is a bias.
                       \
                        This is the enchantment def / keyword.

After the enchantment definition, you can list as many biases as you want. The biases can be:
  -A group tag. Groups are groups of objtypes.
  -The "all" tag. this allows it to be added to ANYTHING.
  -An item object type. Allows it to be added to that specific item.

How to make a new group
***********************
Open up the config file sithmagicitems\configuration\itemgroups.cfg
To make a new group, create a new element like:

ItemGroup myBias
{
    #Items here
}

Then add the object types of the items you want in that group, followed by a 1:

ItemGroup myBias
{
    #myitems
    0x7000 1
    0x7001 1
}

Once youve put all the items you want into your group, goto the top of the config file and add your group to the "allGroups" element:

GroupGroup allGroups
{
	igroup else
	igroup clothes
	igroup wep
	igroup arm
	#my shards groups
	igroup myBias
}

If you want to be able to add sockets to the items in your group, then add it to the "socketables" group as well (just below "allGroups").

Once youve done that, then you can use it just like the other biases in your enchantment headers:

	Enchantment myEnchantment myBias
