Copy the folder "sithmagicitems" from the zip, to your 'systems' directory (based on 94 distro).
  pol\pkg\systems\

So you now have...
  pol\pkg\systems\sithmagicitems\

Now you have to enable the package. Open the "pkg.cfg" in the "sithmagicitems" directory. 
It should look like this:

Enabled 0
Name sithmagicitems
Author S!tH
Version 1.14

Change the line "Enabled" to 1, so it looks like:

Enabled 1
Name sithmagicitems
Author S!tH
Version 1.14

Now youve finished step1! Onto step2.txt :)
