If you want to have spell resistences and bonuses (w00t):

Open your pol\scripts\include\spellRestrictions.inc file
 -At the top, put:


include "../pkg/systems/sithmagicitems/sench";


 -Scroll down to the "Resisted" function,
 -Change the top to to:



function Resisted(circle, caster, cast_on, amt, spellType := "")
  if( spellType )
    amt := calculateMagikool( caster, cast_on, amt, spellType );
  endif



 -In the spells you want to use, pass the ID (string) onto the end of the Resisted function, ie:


    Resisted(circle,caster,cast_on,dmg,"fstrike")
