****************************************
Adding new WasHitScript & DidHitScript's
****************************************

For the sake of tidyness, all WasHitScript and DidHitScript's should go into the "enchScripts" folder.

The variables passed are in an array as such:

  DidHitScript:
                { attacker, defender, weapon, armor, basedamage, rawdamage }
  WasHitScript:
                { attacker, defender, weapon, armor, basedamage, rawdamage, armourPiece }


ArmourPiece is the piece of armour with the enchantment being run.
The others are the same as passed from the mainhitscript... (except rawdamage :P)
Example hitscripts can be found in sithmagicitems\enchScripts

**********************************
Making an enchantment run a script
**********************************
In the enchantments entry in the senchantedhit.cfg file, add:

  	WasHitScript enchScripts\myWasHitScript
        DidHitScript enchScripts\myDidHitScript

Eg:

Enchantment m_thorns
{
	Name m_thorns
	Suffix thorns

	WasHitScript enchScripts\thorned

	AddRanProp t_r_amt 40
	noNormalMods 1
	idstring $t_r_amt#% of damage also effects attacker.
	level 4
}

******************************
Returning Damage
******************************
Damage is returned much like variables in any function, ie:

rawdamage := rawdamage * 2;
return rawdamage;

************************
Important Notes
************************
Your hitscripts should _NEVER_ sleep!

The time that each hitscript sleeps will be added to the time 
it takes between when a person hits someone, and when the damage gets to them.

If you need to simulate something like mana draining slowly,
then start a new script using start_script - and let that one do the sleeping :)
