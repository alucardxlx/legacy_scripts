*******************
Authors note (lol!)
*******************

While the aim of this script is to make making magic items simple, fast and easy... the system might take a while to setup. If your used to setting up new scripts + modding others, then it should be pretty easy.


IMPORTANT:
This script was created for use and distrobution among the POL community, to help enhance the magikool items on shards everywhere, this is for a few reasons:
 1) I hate OSI.
 2) I love POL.
 3) I hadn't seen any other good magic item systems available.
 4) I was bored.
 5) Part of #3, nobody with a half decent magic item system shared it.

So, the only thing I want in return is co-operation with the following terms of use:
 1) Gis an email/ICQ if you use this, and tell us what updates you would like to see.
 2) If you have funky enchantments, by all means, share an enchantment pack
 3) This package is provided "as is", I cannot guarantee any support for the package but I will try to help you on any problems. I cannot be held responsible for any damage that any or all parts of this script incur to your system(s) or others.

The new installation guides can be found in the zip file, under "docs\installation\"


********************
*Using enchantments*
********************
Enchantments can be found as magic items
 a) On the weapon already (naturals)
 b) On an enchantment tome
  +
  Double click on enchantment tome, then click on a dwarven runestone (you will have to add these to your shard somewhere or see sench.inc to make them spawn with the enchantments already on them) to enchant it with that tome.

  To then socket a dwarven runestone into an item, double-click the runestone and click on a socketed item (requires socketers tools, 0x7902) to insert it.

 c) GMs can use the following textcmds:
    .addsench [enchantment_def]      adds enchantments. works for blank runestones as well as weapons.
    .nukesench                       will remove all enchantments on an item
    .setslots [amount]               will set the amount of slots on an item (nukes runes in slots but not their effects!)
    .killsench [ench_def]            removes enchantment specified

Info on making enchantments and more editing is in the "docs" folder
