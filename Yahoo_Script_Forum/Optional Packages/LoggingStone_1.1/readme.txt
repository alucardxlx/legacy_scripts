This is a fairly simple logging script. 
You will need to download my DataFile.inc which can be found
in the includes area of the pol script forum and place it in
your pol/scripts/include directory.

Just place the package in your pol/pkg directory and compile
the scripts.

When in game, create the logging stone (.create loggingstone)
and double click it, to set its name, and enable/disable logging.

	# Planned
		- Language filters
		- Checking for duplicate stones
		- Wipe logs
		- Date and or time stamping


//--=[ !Notes! ]=------------
It does not check for other stones in the world with the same name
and its highly reccomended you dont make 2 stones at the same time
with the same name. However, if you make a new stone with the name
a previous stone had, it will append to its log.
