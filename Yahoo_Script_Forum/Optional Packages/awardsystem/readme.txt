K so heres the award package I think its pretty much all here its just based on races and classes outlined in awardsystem.cfg
I have been able to recieve at least 3 rewards 1st of which is always nightsight (and it appears to activate automatically, like a few others)
Ive changed the cfg so it checks just for race or class at the moment (i took the skill check part out for testing purposes) you can compare to your files if you want that option back.
I also added the awardbook to the all section in startitems.cfg so everyone gets a book to start (not sure how they did it on moe)
Let me know if theres anything I can do to help as that was gonna be one of my next projects.
