RotateStuff2.src
RotateStuff3.src
RotateStuff4.src
	Rotates Items with 2,3 and 4 views when double-clicked.  The code uses a CProp (Facing) to cycle thru the views.  Note the error check.  Bad Idea?  Maybe check for low Dex? Comments?

Rotate0.src
Rotate1.src
Rotate2.src
Rotate3.src
	Set the Facing variable on creation.  Ugly way to do it, but its a lot less work then accessing a cfg file.

RotateMulti1.src
	Rotates two piece objects from either end.  Tried three pieces, but error checking is almost impossible?

itemdesc.cfg
	This is were all the work is.  I'm willing to do it, but I want to make sure everybody is happy first :)

pkg.cfg
	Enabled by default, Set Enabled to 0 to Disable.
