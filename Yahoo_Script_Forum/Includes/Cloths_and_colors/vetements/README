First release : Nov 29 (Boum)

This package allows you to cloth your NPC (especially merchants). Useful for creating new shards.
The 3 config files (equip2.cfg, colors.cfg & cloths.cfg) must go in the config directory (I didn't want to make a package, these enhancements can be made without restarting the server).
The include file (vetement.inc) goes in the script/include directory.

You may then change your AI scripts, for example merchant.src (in script/ai dir), or copy the script in the package if you have your own scripts that uses EquipFromTemplate core function.

To do this, add an include line with vetement and replace the EquipeFromTemplate with Habille (this function uses the same parameters).

Once all is done, recompile, and '.unload merchant' you may restart your NPC merchants.

To change equipment list edit the config files (explained enough in them). equip2 may be a copy from equip.cfg, it has been created just not to crush the original file.
