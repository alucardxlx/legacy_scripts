Winds of Chaos v1.0b
By: Sigismund

What does this do?  Essentially, it's a "bad effect"
generator for miscast spells.   It's a series of functions
that will cause random effects to occur to players
unlucky enough to blow a spell.

Files you need:
chaoseffects.inc   (put in /include dir)
chaoseffects.cfg   (put in all packages that use the table)

I've also included 4 sample spells that have been modified
for the chaos effects: Agility, Recall, Gate, and Res.  The
.inc is well documented, and these 4 samples should give
enough of a lesson to get yourself started.

Happy hunting!
