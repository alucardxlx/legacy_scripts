    * * CHANGES * * 

	->  Stealthsteps are now randomized
	->  Harder to do if mobiles are around (see 1)
	->  Checks to see if in stealth mode
	->  possibility to uncomment chr.stealthsteps := 0 and delete private message
		this would trick the character using stealth so that he would not
		know if he got stealth or not

/////////////////////////////

1:   The check goes like so:

	a random integer is took from the # of mobiles multiplied by 2
	if this number is less than the # of mobiles than it will go onto skill checks.

     This means the chance is always 50 %, but the lower the number, the better the chance of getting greater than that number, because the # of possible numbers drawed from random are less.
