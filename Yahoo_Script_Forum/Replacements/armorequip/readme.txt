Rewrite by Marlboro.man 7 / 11 / 2000 (marlmagg@tin.it)

Just overwrite the extisting files.
Fixed a bug that happened on startup. If you skip the startup phase when you read the equiparmor script it stores 0 in dexterity_mod even if armor is equipped.

Modified equiptest to be sure you have enough dexterity to equip armor.
