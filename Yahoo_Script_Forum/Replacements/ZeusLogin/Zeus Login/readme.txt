	This script replaces the normal login.src and logofftest.src. It notifiys players when staff is on, through messages like : "There are now 1 Game Masters online." also sets up privilages for staff members with cmd level at admin or higher on login. The privilages are : Seeinvisitems, seeghosts, hearghosts, and dyeany. Also all staff members with command level of councelor or higher get the invul priv. 
It also broadcasts when a player signs on for example "Flamage has joined Dark Spawn". The player recvies a "Welcome to Dark Spawn!" sys message in the bottem corner.
