OSI housing system

By Developer Link


I started to create this house system a long time ago, it took a long time because of all the features, they include:

-Physically banning someone from entering your house due to a ban tile placed at the door.

-Viewable Friends, Co-owner and house enemy list

-Viewable Delete List for friends , co-owners and enemies of the house

-you can change the sign graphic to either a guild sign or a store sign, if it is public.

-secure a bag feature, "I wish to secure this", you can secure any bag and unsecure it and take it away,

-Same old features "i ban thee", "remove thyself", 

DOWNSIDE:

you will NOT be able to use this system with tents, i didn't add tents to this because i have always seen tents as useless houses, 


INSTALLATION:

place key.src in scripts\items

this has the code so a player can't lock a public house

place the rest of the files in pkg\std\housing





I am releasing this code with out comments, and some re-used code because of the lack of time.

it is fully functional, pretty well tested, 

all i ask in return is that you will not take this code and say you wrote it, give credit where credit is due
