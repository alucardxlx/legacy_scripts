.spawnmanager

  This is the way you will configure all of your groups and regions.
  The first gump offers two options: groups and regions.
  The groups gump show the existing spawn groups. To manage them, press the corresponding button. Also, you can add a new group.
  The group gump shows the group actual name and templates. To remove a template from the group, press its button. To add a new template, use the add button. You can change the group name, also. To save the changes, press apply.
  The regions gump shows the existing spawn regions, and allows the creation of a new one.
  The region gump shows the region name and the button used to access the individual region features.
  The Rectangles are the region boundaries, the areas in which creatures will be created.
  The Groups define the amount of npcs from a spawn group which may exist at the region in a given time. Time respawn is defined in minutes.
  The Specials define the max amount and respawn time of individual templates.
  Enabled is 1/0, Yes/No. A disabled region does not respawn creatures.
  Flash Spawn Region forces a region to spawn all its npcs instantly.
  Restart Region removes existing region npcs.
  Erase region erases region from regionfile. This action cannot be undone.

  Spawnmanager supports concurrent managing. That means more than one person can manage groups and regions. To keep data consistent, just one person can manage a single group/region at a time. So, if you are editing Group #1, other staff can only edit Group #2 or any Region, as an example.

.buildmanagers

  This command creates new region managers for regions which have none at the time the command is called. Existing region managers are unaffected.

.removemanagers

  Removes any existing region managers, which removes their spawned npcs.

.restartmanagers

  Restarts any existing region managers, removing their spawned npcs.
