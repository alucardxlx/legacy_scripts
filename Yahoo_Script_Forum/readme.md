# This directory contains scripts from the now defunct Yahoo!   #
# Script Forum. They are presented here for archival purposes.  #
#                                                               #
# These scripts date back to as late as 2002. Hence they are    #
# very old and WILL require serious upgrading to run on any     #
# version of POL later than POL 0.94. If you should be brave    #
# enough to attempt to use them be aware of a couple of things. #
#                                                               #
