This is a pretty easy script to configure. First thing you need to do is add the contents of "addtoplayermerchant.txt" to the top of your playermerchant.src file. This will make the merchants "register" themselves with the system.

Next, put the other files in your /www directory and compile them. Viola! You're all set.

You can change the map, of course. The script is looking for a file called "mythmap.jpg", so either name yours the same way, or change the script.

If you do your own map, then make sure it's 640x512 in size.


Bugs:

the only one I know of is that the locator thingie only works with MSIE 5.0 or better (Nutscrape's DHTML kinda sucks)
