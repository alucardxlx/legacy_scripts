Shilohen and Rampage account creator.

We wrote this script becouse we discovered that the standard account creator provided with POL is quite poor, so we decided
to add some cool features.
The SRC file has been rewritten completelly and there if can look similar to the standard one that's just a coincidence.

INSTALLING:
to run this script the only thing you have to do is unpacking it in a directory of your choice in the scripts/www directory and enable the POL integrated web server.

FEATURES:
- It creates account (lol, it was obvious)
- Different pages for any different error to make it easy to edit their look to adapt to your shard site
- By editing the script you can put html pages on a different webserver to make the pol webserver job smaller and requiring less resources to process.
- it addns a cprop for each account containing the e-mail address.
- an e-mail address is required to create the account
- the username must have a minimum of 4 characters and a maximum of 10 ( can be changed in the SRC file easly to adapt the script to your needs. )
- The password must have a minimum of 6 characters to be accepted ( it can be changed too )
- The password must be different from the username, same username and password are not accepted.
- You must use your ISP provided e-mail address, hotmail and so on are banned domains ( you can add or remove banned domains editing the src file, next release provide a different file for easly editing )
- Can't use the same e-mail address to create multiple accounts.

Hoping you to enjoy this script, wich has been really useful for me i see you good bye.
